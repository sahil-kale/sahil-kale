### Hey there, I'm Sahil ðŸ‘‹

I'm a mechatronics engineering student at UWaterloo interested in embedded systems, vehicular automation, and aviation.

Outside of figuring out where I'm missing semicolons, I love to go flying and share the thrill of flight with friends. Sometimes with an engine, sometimes without ðŸ˜‰<br/>
âš¡ Fun fact: I got my pilot licence before my drivers' licence!
