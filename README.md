### Hey there, I'm Sahil ðŸ‘‹

I'm a mechatronics engineering student at UWaterloo with an interest in embedded systems, vehicular automation, and aviation. 

Currently, I'm working with UWARG as a firmware developer to build an autonomous aircraft for the UAS competition next summer, as well as with UWRT as an EE designer to help design boards for the URC 2021 competition.

Some of my projects that you can find on here include:
- A teleoperated snow plow (because who want's to wake up at 6 to shovel the snow ðŸ¤”)
- Hackathon Projects (most recently, a COVID smart assistant for Hackthe6ix)
- A discord bot with over 300+ users that I led and manage the development of

Outside of code, I love to go flying and share the thrill of flight with friends. At the moment, I'm working on my Soaring Association of Canada Bronze Badge to work on cross-country gliding
âš¡ Fun fact: I learned how to fly airplanes before I learned how to drive a car!
