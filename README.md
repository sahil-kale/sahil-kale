### Hey there, I'm Sahil ðŸ‘‹

I'm a mechatronics engineering student at UWaterloo interested in embedded systems, vehicular automation, and aviation. 

I'm currently working with UWARG as a firmware developer to build an autonomous aircraft for the UAS competition next summer and with UWRT as an electrical designer to help design boards for the URC 2021 competition.

Some of the projects that you can find on here include:
- A teleoperated snowplow (because who wants to wake up at 6 to shovel the snow ðŸ¤”)
- Hackathon Projects (most recently, a COVID smart assistant for Hackthe6ix)
- A discord bot with over 300+ users that I led and managed the development of

Outside of code, I love to go flying and share the thrill of flight with friends. At the moment, I'm working on my Soaring Association of Canada Bronze Badge to work on cross-country gliding!<br/>
âš¡ Fun fact: I got my pilot licence before my drivers' licence!
