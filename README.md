### Hey there, I'm Sahil ðŸ‘‹

I'm a mechatronics engineering student at UWaterloo interested in embedded systems, vehicular automation, and aviation.

Feel free to check out some of my projects! 

Outside of figuring out where I'm missing semicolons, I love to go flying and share the thrill of flight with friends. At the moment, I'm working on my Soaring Association of Canada Bronze Badge to glide cross-country!<br/>
âš¡ Fun fact: I got my pilot licence before my drivers' licence!
